# Aedes-borne virus risk higher in areas with both mining and cocoa compared with mining only
# or cocoa only?
# 
# - mosquito larval habitats - forest edge areas, small water bodies from mining
# - changes to mosquito community composition due to changes in predators/ biodiversity 
# including differences between other Aedes spp, Ae. aegypti aegypti and Ae. albopictus
# - human movement
# - water insecurity

# the scale of the mosquito and human surveys will be different - mosquitoes at smaller scale
# and comparison between specific habitats within each of the areas selected 
# for comparison of human exposure risk
